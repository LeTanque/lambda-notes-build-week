# Front End Project Week

[Deployed](https://kind-goodall-9c1833.netlify.com)

This week you will be building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes."

The main objective of this week is to develop the MVP feature set listed below using react and any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda School.

## MVP Features:

- [ ] Display a list of notes
- [ ] Create a note with a title and content
- [ ] View an existing note
- [ ] Edit an existing note
- [ ] Delete an existing note
- [ ] Wire up your static React App to our Notes API.
- [ ] We want to work with some data that will be persistent across a server. [We have built a Notes API](/NOTES.md) for you. You'll find information about this server in the NOTES.md file.
