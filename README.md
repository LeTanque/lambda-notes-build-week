# Front End Project Week

(Deployed)[https://kind-goodall-9c1833.netlify.com]

This week you will be building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes."

You are to treat this week as if you are working at a company and the instructor is your client. The project managers will be your main support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop the MVP feature set listed below using react and any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda School. There are design files in this repository you should use as a creative guide.

## Git Commits

- You are required to showcase progress with at least 1 commit a day. This will let your project manager know where you are and if you need help. This also allows the client to get progress reports from the company in a real world setting.

## Trello Set Up:

- [ ] Create a Trello account
- [ ] Create a new board called "Lambda Notes - {Your Name}"
- [ ] Create lists titled `backlog`,`To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`
- [ ] Fill in the `To Do` list with the MVP features listed below
- [ ] Fill in the `backlog` list with all the extra features listed below
- [ ] Share your board with the project manager that has been assigned to you. If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your lead PM for guidance
- [ ] Add your Trello URL to your project's README.md file. Commit the change, push it to your repository & submit a pull request

## MVP Features:

- [ ] Display a list of notes
- [ ] Create a note with a title and content
- [ ] View an existing note
- [ ] Edit an existing note
- [ ] Delete an existing note
- [ ] Wire up your static React App to our Notes API.
  - We want to work with some data that will be persistent across a server. [We have built a Notes API](/NOTES.md) for you. You'll find information about this server in the NOTES.md file.
